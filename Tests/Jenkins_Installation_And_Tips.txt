NoteL Below Jenkins instructions and tips were capture from the Java Selenium/REST Assure class. And are updated for
this Python-Selenium class:

R)    Jenkins: was downloaded from the official website: https://jenkins.io/download and downloaded the "Generic java packge (.war)" into
       the c:\jenkins folder.
       To start jenkins: open a CMD prompt, and go to the folder where jenkins was downloaded and enter the command:
          "C:\Jenkins>java -jar jenkins.war -httpport=9090" ENTER key
- Jenkins server will start running, just wait for the message "Jenkins is fully up and running"
- To access it, go to a browser and type: http://localhost:8080 or http://locahost:9090
New instruction to Define and execute a Jenkins project to run the Python Selenium created project using the Jenkins webPage apps:
    + To create a new Jenkins project, Click on "New Item", select the "Free style project" and provision the name "SeleniumPythonFirstTest" and
      click the OK button at the bottom.
    + In the General tab, in the Description section click on the "Advance.." button to provide the "path" where our Python project
        (or our source code) is located (C:\Users\ssshh\PycharmProjects\E2EFrameWork),
    + Click on the option "Use Custom Workspace" and in the Directory variable provision the path:
        "C:\Users\ssshh\PycharmProjects\E2EFrameWork",
         Note: Let the 'Source Code Management' as 'None' because we are using the code from this indicated Directory.
    + To provision the command to run our Python-Selenium project, go to the "Build" section of the page,
      click it and open the "add build step" listbox
    + Selec "Execute Windows batch command" "Execute Shell" and provision the PyTest command we used in the CMD prompt:
        - cd to the directory containing the pyTest.py script to execute: 'cd test'
        - write the execution command:
            py.test test_xxx_test_name.py --html=$WORKSPACE/Reports/hectorResultwithLog.html --browser_name firefox -k Smoke
                 where $WORKSPACE is a reference to a Jenkins environment variable for the project Path.
                       Reports is the folder containing all the reports generated.
            NOTE: - When running from Jenkins we do not use the ' -v and -s' flags instead we use the --html=RptName.html
                    because we want the html report to include all 'log' generated and the screenshot if failing testCases.
                  - --browser_name firefox/chrome/Opera... is a flag that we created to indicate on which browser we
                      want to execute the testCase at execution time.
       to the command will be something like:
            py.test test_04_3_FillingFormDataDrivenList_DictionaryFromExternalDataFile.py --html=$WORKSPACE\Reports\hectorResultwithLog.html --browser_name firefox
                #    + All pyTest programs in a pyTest package with: py.test
                #    + Specific pyTest program with: py.test test_02AddCustomer.py
                #    + Specific testCases in all pyTest programs in a pyTest package, we have to identify
                #      a series of keywords (non case sensitive) in the name of each testCases and use
                #      the parameter '-k':
                #           py.test -k CreditCard  (all testCases with 'CreditCard' in their name)
                #    + Specific testCases in one specific pyTest.py program in a pyTest package, we have to
                #      identify a series of keywords (non case sensitive) in the name of each testCases and
                #      use the parameter '-k':
                #           py.test test_02AddCustomer.py -k creditcard
                #     + To run certain testCases as Smoke Test or Regression we have to use 'Marks' to
                #       identify or tag them in the pyTest program and then use these 'Marks' in the
                #       execution command. Marks are similar to Tag (@) in Cucumber, or Groups in TestNG.
                #       So in the pyTest program add the Marks, to each testCase, using this format:
                #          @pytest.mark.keywordWeWantToUse.  i.e. @pytest.mark.regression, @pytest.mark.smoke01
                #          we can mark one testCase with more than one mark:
                #          @pytest.mark.regression
                #          @pytest.mark.smoke01
                #          def test_validateReceipt():
                #               print(xxx)
                #
                #        And in the execution command use the parameter -m keywordWeWantToUse (-m for mark):
                #        py.test -m regression
                #        py.test -m smoke01
                #     + To skip execution of the testCase we can mark it as skip and when we send execution
                #          of all the tests marked as skip won't be executed. We have to use the mark:
                #          @pytest.mark.skip before the 'def' for the testCase
                #     + If we have a testCase that we know that it is failing, but we want to execute it
                #           and not report it as failing because it creates something that is needed in others
                #           testCases, so we can mark it with the xfail (exclude failing report):
                #           @pytest.mark.xfail.

                # 7- flags/Parameters used:
                #     -k stands for only execute the testCases/Methods having 'keywords' in the names.
                #     -m execute marked testCases

    + Click on Save button.
    + To run the project in Jenkins we just need to click on the "Build Now" button.
    + To filter what @Test to execute we have to Parameterize the Jenkins project by making these changes:
        . In the "General" tab, Description section: Check the "This project is Parameterized" checkbox.
        . Select "Choice Parameter" as the type of parameter.
            * provision "JenkinsBrowserName" OR "JenkinsRunType" in the Name field.
            * provision these choices:
                    Chrome
                    Firefox
                    Opera
                    IE
             OR
                    Regression
                    SmokeTest

        . In the "General" tab, Build section: modify the execution command by adding the created "tag" parameter as follow:
                    py.test test_04_3_FillingFormDataDrivenList_DictionaryFromExternalDataFile.py
                         --html=$WORKSPACE\Reports\hectorResultwithLog.html --browser_name "%JenkinsBrowserName%"
                         --running_environment "%JenkinsRunningEnv%"
                         --run_type "%JenkinsRunType%"
                    Note: the "%JenkisVariableName%" indicates that a parameter is used.
                            For Windows environment we use %%, for Linux use only one $, like "$JenkinsVariable"
      + NOW to run the project in Jenkins we just need to click on the "Build with Parameters" button instead of the "Build Now" button.

    More to update in creating JUnit for Results report (need to adap to Python):
            VERIFY THAT THE TESTNG PLUGIN and/or JUnit plugin (for SOAPUI) IS NOW ATTACHED TO THE Jenkins project:
        1- Go to the Jenkins project.
        2- On the left menu, click on "Configure" link.
        3- Go to the "Post-Build Actions" section
        4- click on the "Post-Build Actions" list box and select the "Publish TestNG Results" or "Publish JUnit Test Result Report" option.
        5- Verify that:
        - For Maven/TestNG: the field "TestNG XML report pattern" is automatically populated with the .xml file
        in the "Target" new folder "sunfire reports": **/testng-results.xml
        - For SOAPUI/JUnit: In the "Test Report XMLs" field provision this
        **/TEST-AutomaationGrovvyTestSuite.xml   OR
        **/reports/TEST-AutomaationGrovvyTestSuite.xml, **/reports/TEST-FirstTestSuite.xml  OR
        **/reports/*.xml
        for Python I have used: **\*.xml
        These files are included in the folder
          where the xml report is created.  Note from website: "* only matches any files in workspace directory/folder, if the artifacts you want to
          archive is in some subdirectories, you need the pattern like **/*.xml to match all files in all subdirectories with postfix .xml.
          The workspace directory/folder is:
             - For SOAPUI testRunner: C:\Program Files\SmartBear\SoapUI-5.4.0\bin
             - For Maven: ${JENKINS_HOME}/Maven-Selenium-app "

        6- Click on Save button.
        7- Now the TestNG Results report will be generated every time the project runs, either by "Build Now" or
        scheduled.





    Below are the notes from my original installation located in file /Maven-Selenium-app/ZZ_JenkinsInstallationAndTips in Selenium
    project: C:\Users\ssshh\Maven-Selenium-app. Maybe some are not applicable now but saved time in rewriting new instruction from Rahul.

jenkins is a very important tool for developer and testing, because it is a Continue Integration tool that
was developed mainly for automation of the daily manual commands we issue for everything, like deploying
the code, copying files, etc. Also, assuming we have 500 test in Eclipse, taking 7 hours to run, and instead of running then in
Eclipse or in Maven manually, we can create a job in Jenkins to trigger automatic execution a 2:00 am.
Jenkins only knows that have to execute some script or command, any type.
Jenkins provide a user friendly environment to view the reports of the automated test execution. this is possible through
having the URL of the Jenkins Project. In this Jenkins project if we want to execute the command now, we
just have to click the "Build Now" button and to see the result they can click the result button. This
means that having the Jenkins project URL any one can run the automated tests and see the results.

Jenkins runs on it own server, so we need to set up Java and Maven to it. and based on the Java and Maven
version that we indicate/installed Jenkins will run for that indicated version. this means, that if we
have a TestNG version 6, but we want to execute the tests on version 5 (because it is more stable) we can
indicate to Jenkins to use TestNG version 5. So Jenkins runs with the version of its own environment and
this avoid the issues of different version related to the TestNG or Selenium version installed in every
person machine. because all the test cases will always run in the version that we have provide in the
Jenkins environment. *** It is a good practice that the business management see the testing result from
the Jenkins environment by us sharing the Jenkins URL to our project.

INSTALLING Jenkins.
Normally in each company they will have centralized servers where they install Jenkins, so we don't have to install
there, but if its needed we know how to because here we are installing Jenkins in our local host machine:
1- Google: Jenkins download
2- click on the official site download to get to here: https://jenkins.io/download/
3- In local host, we are going to be using Jenkins as window's service, not at hosting the service, so
we have to go down and click on "Generic Java Package (.war)" for "Long Term Support (LTS) on left
column.
4- For download: I have created a new c:\Jenkins folder to received the jenkins.war file
5- Open a cmd session and move to the folder where the downloaded jenkins.war is located: cd c:\jenkins folder

6- to start the jenkins server in issue: c:\jenkins> java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=8080
could be any free port in the machine, like 8089. Wait until this message is displayed:
INFO: Completed initialization
Jun 20, 2018 4:29:13 PM hudson.WebAppMain$3 run
INFO: Jenkins is fully up and running

7- follow instrutions to get the initial password 7c76c5bccfe541f0bbe4d8a11b5cbbe4 in directory:
c:\users\ssshhh\.jenkins\secret, paste it in the pop window and click continue
8- Select install all pluggins and click next,
9- when finished: I have created the new userId: hectorAdmin with p a ss wrd: saibaba0
10- in instance configuration I have selected
Jenkins URL:  http://localhost:8080
11- Process is completed.
12- Open a new browser windows and user URL: http://localhost:8080/login
13- Use userid: hectorAdmin/saibaba0

14- To configure Jenkins we need these softwares: Maven and Java (Not, we dont need Selenium, TestNg..)
Maven has an excellent integration with Jenkins, so that we can use all Maven projects in Jenkins.
Jenkins has pluggins and commands to work with Maven, so that Jenkins can access all Maven commands
and run then on behalf of us.
To setup Maven and Java, click on "Manage Jenkins" link.
15- click on the "Global tools configuration" link.
click on Add JDK.
provide the name: jdk1.8.0_201
provide JAVA_HOME: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_171
On Maven panel
provide the name: Maven-3.6.3
provide MAVEN_HOME: C:\Maven\apache-maven-3.6.3
16- Click on Save button.

CONNECTING A MAVEN PROJECT INTO JENKINS ENVIRONMENT.
1- Copy the Maven Folder containing ALL the code for the Maven's project (Maven-Selenium-app, in c:\users\ssshh\) to the
Jenkins directory $JENKINS_HOME (c:\users\ssshh\.jenkins. Now Jenkins has all the code of the Maven
project in its environment and directly available for execution in Jenkins.
Note: if I have a Postman code, I also have to copy it first to Jenkins so Jenkins can execute it.
1.1 Copy the pom.xml and all others .xml files from Maven to this same directory

2-In Jenkins main page click on "New Item" link to create a new Jenkins Job/Project.
3- Enter the Item/Job/Project name: HectorFirstMavenProject
4- Select the "Freestyle Projet" option and click Ok button.
5- To provide the location of the Maven project code in Jenkins environment, In the General tab.
5.1- Click on the "Advance.." button to show more option.
5.2- Click on the "Use Custom Workspace" option
5.3- In the directory box: Provide the directory of the Maven project in Jenkins, this is:
- For Maven: ${JENKINS_HOME}/Maven-Selenium-app
  This ${JENKINS_HOME} will execute and get the content of the JENKINS_HOME environment variable.
- For SOAPUI indicate the "testRunner" path directory: C:\Program Files\SmartBear\SoapUI-5.4.0\bin

Note-1: For companies having the code in Github or Subversion server, then we have to select the
corresponding option in section "Source Code Management", instead of the "Advance..", so
for execution, Jenkins download the code from these webserver (Github or Subversion).
Because, in this case, we have not specify the use of any of this webserver, Jenkins will be
using the "Custom Workspace" defined here.

Note-2: If we want to automatically trigger the execution of this project based on some schedule,
then we can use the section "Build Triggers" here we can use:
- "Build Periodically" option to define the schedule we want to Job/build/project to run.
- "Build after other projects are build" option to trigger execution of this job/build/project
for example, after deploying a new build code to System Test then running an automatic
Regresion or Smoke test, etc.
6- To provide the command to execute the Maven Test project:
6.1- Click on the Build link.
6.2- In "Adding Steps" select:
- For Maven: "Invoke top-level Maven Targets" option
- For SOAPUI: "Execute Windows batch commnad"
6.2.1 insert step to Delete any previous *.xml:
For SOAPUI: del C:\SOAP_UI\Reports\*.xml

- FOR MAVEN:
6.3- Select the Maven version that we configured before in Global Tools.
6.4- In the Goals enter the Maven command we want to execute: test -PRegression
OR  test
OR  test -PSmoke  (for execution using PROFILED test Suite for Smoke test)
- FOR SOAPUI enter below command in the command panel:
6.5- testrunner.bat -sAutomaationGrovvyTestSuite -cGroovyScriptTestCase -r -a -j -J -f C:\SOAP_UI\Reports -I C:\SOAP_UI\04AutomationWithGroovySOAPProject-soapui-project.xml
        here -s is the TestSuite. (xxx or all)
         -c is the test case. (xxx or all)
         -r indicate generate Report
         -j indicate generate report in JUnit format.
         -f indicate the path of the report to be created: C:\SOAP_UI\Reports.  Note: the *.xml file created here then will be copied to folder
                  C:\Program Files\SmartBear\SoapUI-5.4.0\bin\reports (note the folder "reports" was added by me to in order to be able to
                  provision this **/TEST-AutomaationGrovvyTestSuite.xml in the "Test Report XMLs" field later in the configuration.
         -I indicate continue execution if an error was found, this allows the Jenkins report graph displays the test in error.
         - Last is the path and name of the project: C:\SOAP_UI\04AutomationWithGroovySOAPProject-soapui-project.xml

6.5.1 ADDING RENAME STEP:
In case we have more than one steps executing (see 6.5) different testCases in the same testSuite we have to rename the xml file
in the "reports" folder adding the date-Time Stamp so that we have multiple .xml file for the same testSuite, INSERT below command:
ren C:\SOAP_UI\Reports\TEST-FirstTestSuite.xml TEST-FirstTestSuite_%date:~-4%%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2%%time:~0,2%%time:~3,2%%time:~6,2%.xml

6.6- Add another step to copy the *.xml file created in c:\SOAP_UI\Reports folder to the ....\reports folder under the workspace folder, for this:
In "Adding Steps" select:
- For SOAPUI: "Execute Windows batch commnad"

6.7- FOR SOAPUI enter below command in the command panel:
copy C:\SOAP_UI\Reports\*.xml "C:\Program Files\SmartBear\SoapUI-5.4.0\bin\reports" /Y

7- Clik on Save buttton. And we have successfully created our first Jenkins project!!!!!

To run the job/build/project from the Jenkins page:
1- Click on the left side menu "Build Now" option
2- The Execution is displayed in the "Build History" panel with a execution number #xxx
3- Wen execution finishes, click on the link created to see the results.
4- click on the "Console Output" to see the result in the console.

MODIFYING THE PROJECT TO INDICATE RUNNING A DIFFERENT MAVEN COMMAND
1- On jenkins main page, on left side menu click on "Configure" option
2- In the Build section, update the Maven command as neeed.

INTEGRATING The TestNG format Output/Result REPORT AFTER RUNNING WITH JENKINS.
- Afte running with Jenkins, if we go to Eclipse and Refresh (PF5 Key) and opening the "Target' folder
we will find the new folder "sunfire reports", opening it we will find the testng-results.xml file, this
file contains all the execution result in xml format and is going to be used by Jenkins to displays
the result in the Webbrowser format. to get this we need to configure the TestNG report plugin
by following below steps:
1- Install the TestNG pluggin in Jenkins:
2- Go to the Jenkins Dashboard.
3- In the left menu click on the "Manage Jenkins" link
4- Click on "Manage Plugins" link
5- Click on the "Available" tab
6- Search/filter for/by "testng" or "JUnit" in the top righ filter
7- check on the "TestNG Results" "JUnit Plugin" and click on the "Install without restart" button.
Note: JUnit plugin was already installed.
8- verify success message.
9- click on "Go back to the top page" link.

VERIFY THAT THE TESTNG PLUGIN and/or JUnit plugin (for SOAPUI) IS NOW ATTACHED TO THE Jenkins project:
1- Go to the Jenkins project.
2- On the left menu, click on "Configure" link.
3- Go to the "Post-Build Actions" section
4- click on the "Post-Build Actions" list box and select the "Publish TestNG Results" or "Publish JUnit Test Result Report" option.
5- Verify that:
- For Maven/TestNG: the field "TestNG XML report pattern" is automatically populated with the .xml file
in the "Target" new folder "sunfire reports": **/testng-results.xml
- For SOAPUI/JUnit: In the "Test Report XMLs" field provision this
**/TEST-AutomaationGrovvyTestSuite.xml   OR
**/reports/TEST-AutomaationGrovvyTestSuite.xml, **/reports/TEST-FirstTestSuite.xml  OR
**/reports/*.xml
These files are included in the folder
  where the xml report is created.  Note from website: "* only matches any files in workspace directory/folder, if the artifacts you want to
  archive is in some subdirectories, you need the pattern like **/*.xml to match all files in all subdirectories with postfix .xml.
  The workspace directory/folder is:
     - For SOAPUI testRunner: C:\Program Files\SmartBear\SoapUI-5.4.0\bin
     - For Maven: ${JENKINS_HOME}/Maven-Selenium-app "

6- Click on Save button.
7- Now the TestNG Results report will be generated every time the project runs, either by "Build Now" or
scheduled.

SCHEDULING A JENKINS JOB/PROJECT.
1- Being in the project, On the left side menu click on Configure
2- Go to the "Build Trigger" section and click on "Build periodically"
3- Use below format to populate the shedule panel: this is used to define the scheduling of a Jenkins job to run on a specific time:
1- MINUTES - an integer number or '*' for: specific Minute in one hour (0-59)
2- HOURS - an integer number or '*' for: specific Hour in one day (0-23)
3- DAYMONTH - an integer number or '*' for: Specific Day in a month (1-31)
4- MONTH - an integer number or '*' for: Specific Month in year (1-12)
5- DAYWEEK - an integer number or '*' for: Specific Day of the week (0-7) where 0 and 7 are sunday.
Since a few versions, Jenkins added a new parameter "H" to allow periodically scheduled tasks to
produce an even load on the system, the symbol H (for 'hash') should be used wherever possible,
for example using 0 0 * * * for running a 30 daily jobs will cause a large spike at midnight. In
contrast using    H H * * * would still execute each job once a day but not all at the same time
helping to better use of limiting resources.
Note also that the H symbol can be thought of as a random value over a range, but it actually is
a hash of the job name, not a random function, so that the value remains stable for any given
project.
Example 1: H H(3-4) * * * A job which runs every Day of the week, every Month in a year, every Day
in a month, at a time between 3-4 am in the morning, at any minute.

Example 2: H(30-45) 14 * * * A job which runs every Day of the week, every Month in a year, every Day
in a month, at a 2 pm in the afternoon, between 30 - 45 minutes.

Example 3: */5 * * * * If we want to trigger the build every 5 minutes, this will fo the job.
Example 4: 0 8 * * *  this will trigger the build every day at 8 am, 00  minutes.

4- Click on the Save button.
